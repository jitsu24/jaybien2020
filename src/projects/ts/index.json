    "body": "I was approached by a client whose business was doing well, but he was having trouble managing his customers and retaining a long-term assistant to handle the admin work. By leveraging the platforms he was already using, we found a way to automate onboarding clients as well as managing a lot of the tedious processes that would normally be done by hand. Through the Hubspot API, WordPress API, Google Drive API, SendGrid API, Firebase API, I was able to add a lot of functionality to his website while delagating the workload to these proven and trusted services, saving him 50+ hours of manual admin work each month, and allowing him to forego a replacement when his latest assistant left."
